# Functional Koans - F#

A port of [Chris Marino's F# Koans](https://github.com/ChrisMarinos/FSharpKoans) with the koans converted to xUnit tests.

## Motivation

I found having the koans as test made it easier to work through them using your favourite testing tool rather than having to run the custom code that executes the original koans.

## Getting started

Start at the `AboutAsserts.fs` file and work your way through till all tests are passing.

## Running the tests

You can run the tests by

* Executing `dotnet test` from the `src` directory
* Using the test runner in your favourite ide (Visual Studio, Rider, VSCode
